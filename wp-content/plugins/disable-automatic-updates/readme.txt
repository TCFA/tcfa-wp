This plugin disables automatic updates feature in WordPress 3.7+, which is enabled by default..

== Description ==

Pretty simply, this plugin disables the automatic updates feature on a WordPress site running 3.7 or above.

Since 3.7, a typical WordPress install will now be able to automatically update itself when there is a new minor/security release available without any user input. For example, it will automatically update itself from WordPress 3.7 to 3.7.1. Auto updates are not enabled by default for major releases like 3.7.1 to 3.8. For various reasons, site owners may wish to disable this functionality. This plugin provides an easy way to do so.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the disable-automatic-updates to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory in your WordPress installation
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Automatic Updates Feature is now disabled!

To re-enable Automatic Updates Feature, just deactivate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu.
